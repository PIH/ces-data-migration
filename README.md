# CES Data Migration

R scripts for migrating CompaÃ±eros en Salud clinical data from
MS Access to OpenMRS.

Takes CSVs as input. Use ces-access-export to dump CSVs from a
MS Access database. Drop them into `input/`.

Produces CSVs readable by
[Initializer module](https://github.com/mekomsolutions/openmrs-module-initializer/).

### Note for posterity

If you have the option, please, please, do not use R for this task.
Use Python+Pandas. Do not use R for anything you can avoid using R for.
It is an unbelievably bad language.

## Developing

Use Posix newlines and UTF-8 encoding. Strip trailing horizontal
whitespace when saving.
In RStudio, check these settings under Options -> Code -> Saving.

[Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/walkthrough.html) is used
for dependency management.

Use Roxygen-style docstrings. Use `./extract_markdown.sh` to append the file
docstrings to this README.


## Script Documentation

### export_complete_access_csv.R
Exports a giant CSV with all pts and consults

Imports CSVs from `data/input/<site>/`. Uses that data to produce
a giant CSV file. One line per consult, patient data is duplicated
over all their consult rows.


- `OUTPUT_PATH = "data/output/complete_access_data.csv"`

### prepare_consult_enc_and_obs.R
Prepares consult data for OpenMRS-Iniz

Imports CSVs from `data/input/<site>/Consultas.csv`. Uses that data to produce
two CSV files for each encounter type.

- `data/output/encounters-*.csv` contains the consult encounters, one line per patient.
- `data/output/obs-*.csv` contains all the observations for each of those consults.

Data in Access that has no counterpart in OpenMRS is appended to the
consult note (which is coded as "Presenting history").

These output CSVs should then be imported by OpenMRS Initializer module.


- `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH = "data/output/"`

### prepare_patients.R
Converts patient data from Access format to OpenMRS-Iniz

Imports CSVs from `data/input/<site>/Pacientes.csv`. Uses that data to produce
a CSV file, `data/output/patients.csv`, which should be imported by OpenMRS
Initializer module.

Deduplicates patients with identical CesID, Nombre, and Apellido. If those
patients have different data, issues a warning. You should use that warning
to add that patient to `R/patient_util.R:ManualDedupe`, which splits these
patient entries instead of merging them. The duplicates handled by
`ManualDedupe` get `-1`, `-2`, etc. appended to their CesID.

Splits patients with identical CesID but different name or birthdate. Each
distinct patient is assigned a new CesID with suffix `-1`, `-2`, etc.

The logic for this script is almost entirely contained in `R/patient_util.R`.


- `PT_OUTPUT_PATH = "data/output/patients.csv"`

### prepare_program_enrollments.R
Prepares patient-program data for OpenMRS-Iniz

Imports CSVs from `data/input/<site>/Pacientes.csv`, unless preproccessed
Patient data is available at `data/tmp/prepped-patients.csv`.
Uses that data to produce a CSV file at `ENROLLMENTS_OUTPUT_PATH`.

Data in Access that has no counterpart in OpenMRS is appended to the
consult note (which is coded as "Presenting history").

These output CSVs should then be imported by OpenMRS Initializer module.


- `ENROLLMENTS_OUTPUT_PATH = "data/output/program_enrollments.csv"`

### prepare_registration_enc_and_obs.R
Prepares registration data for OpenMRS-Iniz

Imports CSVs from `data/input/<site>/Pacientes.csv`. Uses that data to produce
two CSV files. `ENC_OUTPUT` contains the registration encounters, one line per
patient. `OBS_OUTPUT` contains all the observations, of which there will be 3-5
per patient.

These output CSVs should then be imported by OpenMRS Initializer module.


- `ENC_OUTPUT_PATH = "data/output/encounters-registration.csv"`
- `OBS_OUTPUT_PATH = "data/output/obs-registration.csv"`
